// Head scripts start loading really early before the DOM gets to main processing;you want libraries here so they have time to get going.

//You can put scripts in <body> if you don't want your script to be placed inside a function, 
or if your script should write page content, it should be placed in the body section.


//Javascript in the head is only called when an event is triggered while in the body called when a page loads every refreshing.
